## AcuStaf Technical Problem
Application that sends an API request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to receive To-Do list items. Request is limited to 50 JSON objects. The To-Do list data is rendered in meaningful way for users to see the title of the task and whether that task was completed or not. Completion is displayed using checkboxes; if an item has been completed the checkbox is rendered as checked or if not completed is rendered as an empty checkbox. Users can check the boxes to change the status of the task.
